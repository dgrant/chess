* Always try to compile after you change code.
* Always run ALL tests after you change code.
* Always write new tests for new features.
* Ideally verify that code coverage is 100%.
* Write comments in the code to explain everything that is not obvious.
* Always prefer to use an object-oriented approach. For example, if a method accesses something on a struct, put that method on the struct.
* Always put tests in a separate file, named after the file being tested, with a `_tests.rs` suffix.
